# 1️⃣Capacitated K-means for grouping solar panels
- Capacitated K-means is an extension of traditional K-means clustering algorithm with capacity constraints
- Solves the Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP) by limiting the number of data points per cluster
- Designed to create balanced clusters where each junction box can connect maximum 8 solar panels
- Process includes initialization, cluster assignment respecting capacity limits, centroid recalculation
- Uses Euclidean distance to assign points to nearest clusters without exceeding capacity
- Critical for solar panel grouping to optimize cable connections while maintaining balanced load distribution
