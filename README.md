# 1Ô∏è‚É£Capacitated K-means for grouping solar panels
- Capacitated K-means is an extension of traditional K-means clustering algorithm with capacity constraints
- Solves the Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP) by limiting the number of data points per cluster
- Designed to create balanced clusters where each junction box can connect maximum 8 solar panels
- Process includes initialization, cluster assignment respecting capacity limits, centroid recalculation
- Uses Euclidean distance to assign points to nearest clusters without exceeding capacity
- Critical for solar panel grouping to optimize cable connections while maintaining balanced load distribution

- The objective function minimizes the total cost of cable connections in the solar power plant.
- The first term represents the cost of connecting PVA panels to junction boxes, and second term represents the cost of connecting selected junction boxes to inverters.
- Below is a description of the constraints.  
(2): Variable definition constraint ensuring only one cable type is selected for each connection  
(3): Flow conservation constraint ensuring the difference between incoming and outgoing flow equals 1 for each PVA node (Ph = 1, ‚àÄh ‚àà VT)  
(4): Capacity constraint ensuring flow doesn't exceed the capacity of installed cables  
(5): Constraint limiting each PVA to have exactly one outgoing cable  
(6): Constraint ensuring no outgoing cables from junction boxes  
(7): Constraint allowing only one junction box to be selected  
(8): Constraint linking variables for PVA-to-Inverter connections; ensures cables can only connect to selected junction boxes  


# 3Ô∏è‚É£CCW Algorithm and Lazy Constraints(To prevent crossings)
- CCW (Counter-Clock-Wise) algorithm prevents cable crossing by determining the orientation of three points
- Function calculates whether points are arranged clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear
- CrossingCheck function uses CCW to determine if two line segments intersect
- GetCrossingPair function identifies all crossing cable segments in the solution
- NoCrossingCallback function dynamically adds constraints during optimization to prevent crossings
- Uses "lazy constraints" to ensure selected cable segments don't cross each other
- Algorithm terminates when no more crossing segments are detected during optimization
